/* 
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., 
direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must 
declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general 
form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’

type *var-name;

#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */
   int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

   ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

   printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );

   /* address stored in pointer variable */
   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

   /* access the value using the pointer */
   printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

   return 0;
